Send and receive messages using a cloud-hosted version of the WhatsApp Business 
Platform. The Cloud API allows you to implement WhatsApp Business APIs without 
the cost of hosting of your own servers and also allows you to more easily scale 
your business messaging. The Cloud API supports up to 80 messages per second of 
combined sending and receiving (inclusive of text and media messages).
